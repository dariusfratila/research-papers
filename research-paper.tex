\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Advancements in computer vision have been greatly driven by feature extraction methods such as the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) \citet{Lowe2004} and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) \citet{Dalal2005}. These techniques provided robust and invariant features by highlighting essential patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes, enabling early vision systems to detect objects across varying scales and orientations while handling challenges like occlusion and complex backgrounds.

Around 2010â€“2012, progress in object detection began to plateau. The reliance on manually designed features in traditional methods like SIFT and HOG limited their ability to capture the complex hierarchical and semantic information necessary for accurate object detection in diverse environments. Additionally, these methods were sensitive to noise, deformations, scale variations, and positional shifts, affecting their real-world performance.

To overcome these limitations, researchers drew inspiration from the hierarchical, multi-stage processing of the human visual system's primary visual cortex (V1) \citet{Hubel1968}. Early computational models, such as Fukushima's neocognitron \citet{fukushima:neocognitronbc}, were developed to mimic this structure. The neocognitron, a multi-layered neural network, provided robustness to deformations, scale changes, and positional shifts by capturing complex features and invariances. However, the absence of end-to-end learning capabilities hindered its ability to autonomously learn and adapt from data, thereby constraining its potential for further performance improvements.

This study begins by reviewing foundational methods and related work in section~\ref{background}, tracing the transition from traditional feature-based techniques such as SIFT and HOG to the rise of convolutional neural networks. Section~\ref{cnn} examines the development of CNN architectures, emphasizing their pivotal role in modern object detection frameworks. Section~\ref{rcnn_section} focuses on region-based detection frameworks, analyzing architectures such as R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Section~\ref{advances} discusses recent innovations, including transformer-based models like DETR, anchor-free methods, and advancements such as YOLOR and Swin Transformer V2. Section~\ref{advancements} emphasizes the evolution of real-time object detection, exploring advancements in YOLO models and their applications in time-critical scenarios. Section~\ref{discussions} addresses ongoing challenges, such as improving detection for small objects, optimizing resource usage for mobile and embedded systems, and tackling ethical concerns. Finally, section~\ref{conclusion} wraps up the paper by summarizing the main findings and suggesting future directions for improving object detection research.

\section{Background and Related Work} \label{background}

The evolution of object detection can be traced back to neuroscience and early neural networks. Hierarchical feature extraction, inspired by Hubel and Wiesel's seminal research on the visual cortex \cite{Hubel1968}, influenced the development of Fukushima's Neocognitron \cite{fukushima:neocognitronbc}, which, despite its robustness to distortions, lacked the ability for supervised learning.
    
The introduction of backpropagation enabled models like LeNet-5 \cite{726791} to apply convolutional and pooling layers for pattern recognition, laying the foundation for modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, limited computational power and small datasets hindered their adoption.

While these early methods established the groundwork, the advent of CNNs marked a paradigm shift in object detection. Enabled by advancements in hardware and large-scale datasets, deeper architectures could automatically learn hierarchical features.

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks} \label{cnn}

The evolution of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) accelerated with the rise of increased computational power and the availability of large datasets like ImageNet. AlexNet \cite{Krizhevsky2012ImageNetCW} marked a pivotal moment by demonstrating that deep CNNs could significantly outperform traditional methods in image classification tasks. Key innovations included the use of GPUs for training, ReLU activations for faster convergence, and dropout to mitigate overfitting.

Building on AlexNet's success, VGGNet \cite{simonyan2015deepconvolutionalnetworkslargescale} explored the impact of network depth by using small convolutional filters and increasing the number of layers. While VGGNet achieved impressive results, it faced challenges with computational efficiency due to its large number of parameters. These advancements established CNNs as the backbone of modern computer vision tasks like object detection, and recognition and image segmentation.

The success of CNNs in image classification tasks inspired researchers to extend their application to object detection. However, the challenge of localizing objects within images required significant innovations. Researchers developed region-based detection strategies that leveraged CNNs for both feature extraction and object classification, transforming the field. 

\section{Region-Based Object Detection}\label{rcnn_section}

\subsection{Region Proposal Methods}
Region proposal methods form the foundation of modern object detection systems by generating candidate regions that likely contain objects of interest. These methods emerged as a crucial preprocessing step to reduce the computational burden of exhaustive sliding window approaches while maintaining high recall rates.

Selective Search, introduced by Uijlings et al. (\cite{Uijlings2013SelectiveSF}), remains one of the most influential region proposal methods. It employs a hierarchical grouping algorithm that combines regions based on multiple complementary similarity measures. The method starts with small initial regions (superpixels) and progressively merges them step by step using these similarity measures, creating a variety of region proposals at different scales. This bottom-up approach ensures high recall while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.

While region-based methods like R-CNN and its derivatives improved detection accuracy, their reliance on region proposals limited real-time performance. Processing region proposals separately for feature extraction and classification introduced significant computational overhead, making these methods less practical for applications requiring immediate responses. To address these challenges, single-stage detectors like YOLO introduced unified frameworks for real-time object detection, bypassing the need for explicit region proposals. Simultaneously, the advent of transformer architectures brought a new perspective to detection pipelines by leveraging global relationships rather than focusing solely on localized regions. 
\subsection{R-CNN: Pioneering Region-Based Detection}\label{rcnn}

R-CNN \citet{girshick2014richfeaturehierarchiesaccurate} represents a seminal contribution to object detection by introducing a two-stage framework that integrates region proposal generation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. This methodology begins by generating approximately 2000 candidate regions through the Selective Search algorithm \citet{Uijlings2013SelectiveSF}, a heuristic-based approach that hierarchically merges image segments using similarity criteria such as color, texture, and size. The candidate regions are then resized to a uniform dimension to align with the input requirements of the CNN, enabling the extraction of deep feature representations.

The extracted features are then subjected to classification and localization. Classification is performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained to predict object categories, while a bounding box regressor adjusts the initial region proposals to improve localization accuracy by predicting precise offsets for the bounding box coordinates. This two-stage pipeline allowed R-CNN to achieve considerable improvements in detection accuracy compared to traditional methods reliant on handcrafted features, such as Deformable Parts Models (DPM).

Despite its effectiveness, the R-CNN framework is computationally intensive due to its reliance on independently processing each region proposal through the CNN, resulting in prolonged inference times. Furthermore, the multi-stage training pipelineâ€”comprising separate training for the CNN, SVM, and bounding box regressorâ€”introduces additional complexity, thereby limiting its scalability for real-time applications.

Table~\ref{tab:rcnn_results} summarizes the performance improvements achieved by R-CNN and its related models, measured in mean average precision on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and VOC 2010 datasets. The results highlight the superior performance of R-CNN-based architectures compared to earlier methods, particularly when combined with advanced feature extraction backbones such as VGG-16.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Fast R-CNN}
Fast R-CNN improved upon R-CNN by addressing its computational inefficiencies through a more integrated framework. Instead of independently processing each region proposal, Fast R-CNN processes the entire image to generate a unified convolutional feature map, which reduces redundant computations \citet{girshick2015fastrcnn}. Region proposals are mapped to the feature map via RoI pooling, producing uniform-length vectors for classification and bounding box regression.

This innovation led to substantial performance gains, as shown in Table \ref{tab:fast_rcnn_results}. On the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, Fast R-CNN demonstrated significant performance improvements, reducing training duration from 84 to 9.5 hours \cite{girshick2015fastrcnn} (8.8x speedup) and inference time per image from 47 seconds to 0.32 seconds (146x speedup) while slightly improving mAP from 66.0\% to 66.9\%. Although it slightly increased the mAP from 66.0\% to 66.9\%, its reliance on external region proposal methods like Selective Search limited its suitability for real-time applications.

Table \ref{tab:region_proposal_speedup} highlights the performance of Fast R-CNN when incorporating Selective Search, showing a speedup of 25x compared to R-CNN, reducing test time per image from 50 seconds to just 2 seconds. However, the reliance on this computationally expensive step underscored the need for further optimization.

By unifying the detection pipeline and enabling end-to-end training, Fast R-CNN set a new benchmark in object detection, paving the way for Faster R-CNN \citet{ren2016fasterrcnnrealtimeobject}, which replaced external region proposal methods with an integrated Region Proposal Network (RPN).

\end{table}

\subsection{Faster R-CNN: Integrating Region Proposal Networks}

Faster R-CNN marked a pivotal advancement in object detection by integrating a Region Proposal Network (RPN) into the detection pipeline. Unlike earlier methods relying on external proposal generators like Selective Search, the RPN generates region proposals directly from shared convolutional feature maps, streamlining the pipeline and allowing end-to-end optimization. By predicting objectness scores and bounding box coordinates in real time, this approach eliminated the computational bottleneck of external proposal generation while maintaining detection accuracy.

As presented in Table~\ref{tab:faster_rcnn_results}, Faster R-CNN achieved a 250x speedup in inference time over R-CNN, reducing test time per image to 0.2 seconds, with a maintained mAP of 66.9\% on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset \citet{ren2016fasterrcnnrealtimeobject}. This combination of efficiency and accuracy positioned Faster R-CNN as a benchmark in object detection.

Further advancements involved pairing Faster R-CNN with deeper feature extraction backbones, such as ResNet-101 \citet{he2015deepresiduallearningimage}. Table~\ref{tab:resnet_faster_rcnn_results} showcases its performance on the COCO dataset, highlighting incremental improvements achieved through techniques like box refinement, context incorporation, and multi-scale testing. These enhancements demonstrated the adaptability of Faster R-CNN to diverse and complex object detection scenarios. Notably, the ensemble method achieved the highest performance, with an mAP of 59.0\% at an IoU threshold of 0.5 and 37.4\% across the full range of IoU thresholds.

\end{table}

\subsection{YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection with Unified Frameworks}
The "You Only Look Once" framework revolutionized object detection by adopting a real-time, single-stage approach \cite{redmon2016lookonceunifiedrealtime}. In contrast to region-based methods such as Faster R-CNN, which rely on region proposals followed by classification, YOLO approaches object detection as a unified regression problem. This approach eliminates the need for explicit region proposal generation, significantly improving inference speed while maintaining competitive accuracy.

YOLO divides the input image into a fixed grid, allowing each grid cell to directly predict bounding box coordinates, objectness scores, and class probabilities. These predictions are efficiently processed in a single forward pass through the network, allowing YOLO to achieve real-time performance. For example, YOLOv1 could process images at 45 frames per second (fps) on standard hardware, compared to the sub-1 fps performance of region-based methods.

The YOLO framework excels in scenarios requiring real-time processing, such as self-driving cars and video surveillance. However, its grid-based prediction introduces challenges in detecting small objects or objects located near cell boundaries. Subsequent iterations, such as YOLOv2 and YOLOv3, addressed these limitations by incorporating anchor boxes and feature pyramid networks to improve accuracy and robustness.

Table~\ref{tab:yolo_performance} compares YOLO with both Fast and Faster R-CNN, highlighting the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

\section{Recent Advances in Object Detection Models} \label{advances}
\subsection{Transformer-Based Object Detection Models}

The Detection Transformer (DETR), introduced by Carion et al. \cite{carion2020endtoendobjectdetectiontransformers}, signifies a significant advancement in object detection methodologies by utilizing a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework. DETR redefines object detection as a direct set prediction challenge, thereby removing the need for manually designed components such as anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression (NMS). Its structure consists of a convolutional backbone for feature extraction, followed by a transformer encoder and decoder. The encoder processes the extracted features to capture global relationships through self-attention mechanisms, while the decoder employs a fixed set of learned object queries to predict bounding boxes and class labels.

A pivotal innovation of DETR is the implementation of a bipartite matching loss, specifically utilizing the Hungarian algorithm, to distinctly assign predicted outputs to ground truth objects during training. This set-based global loss facilitates end-to-end training and streamlines the detection pipeline by ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth. However, DETR encounters challenges such as slow convergence and less optimal performance on small objects, attributed to the computational demands of the global attention mechanism.

The table above provides a comparative analysis of three transformer-based object detection modelsâ€”RT-DETR, DETR, and Deformable DETRâ€”evaluated on the COCO dataset. The metrics include mAP for IoU thresholds between 0.50 and 0.95, inference speed in milliseconds per image, the number of model parameters in millions, and computational complexity measured in billions of FLOPs (Floating Point Operations).

To overcome the limitations of DETR, Zhu et al. introduced Deformable DETR \cite{zhu2021deformabledetrdeformabletransformers}, which integrates deformable attention modules to enhance convergence speed and detection accuracy. Deformable attention concentrates on a sparse set of sampling points around a reference, enabling the model to focus on pertinent features more effectively.

By incorporating multi-scale features and substituting the global attention mechanism with deformable attention, Deformable DETR expedites training convergence and improves performance, especially for small objects. It achieves comparable results with significantly reduced training epochs.

\subsection{Anchor-Free Object Detection Methods}

Anchor-free object detection methods have gained attention for simplifying detection pipelines by eliminating the need for predefined anchor boxes. One such method is the Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection (FCOS) proposed by Tian et al. \cite{tian2019fcosfullyconvolutionalonestage}. FCOS directly predicts the distances from each pixel to the four sides of the bounding box along with the object class, operating in a fully convolutional manner. By using feature maps at different pyramid levels to detect objects of various scales, FCOS reduces computational overhead and avoids challenges associated with anchor box design, such as size, aspect ratio, and quantity. It demonstrates competitive performance with anchor-based methods, achieving high accuracy on benchmarks like COCO while being simpler and more flexible.

Another approach involves keypoint-based methods, such as CornerNet \cite{law2019cornernetdetectingobjectspaired} and CenterNet\cite{duan2019centernetkeypointtripletsobject}. These models detect objects by predicting keypoints and inferring bounding boxes from these points. CornerNet identifies the top-left and bottom-right corners of bounding boxes and utilizes an embedding vector to associate matching corners. CenterNet simplifies this by predicting object centers and regressing the size of the bounding box. These methods benefit from not relying on anchor boxes and can effectively detect objects in a single-stage, end-to-end manner. However, they may face challenges with densely packed objects due to keypoint overlap.

\subsection{YOLOR}

YOLOR (You Only Learn One Representation) marks a major breakthrough in object detection methodologies through its integration of explicit and implicit knowledge into a unified network. This novel approach enables YOLOR to excel in multiple vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection, without requiring task-specific architectural modifications. The unification of knowledge types enhances the model's flexibility and effectiveness across various applications.

In terms of performance, YOLOR demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy compared to earlier models. It achieves an 88\% increase in inference speed over Scaled-YOLOv4 models while also exhibiting a 3.8\% improvement in accuracy relative to PP-YOLOv2 \cite{wang2021learnrepresentationunifiednetwork}. These advancements are attributed to YOLOR's innovative feature representation strategies and optimization techniques.

The architecture of YOLOR includes enhancements in feature extraction and task-specific optimization, achieving a delicate balance between computational efficiency and detection precision. These characteristics position YOLOR as a state-of-the-art framework, setting benchmarks for future developments in object detection research.


\subsection{Swin Transformer V2}

The Swin Transformer V2 improves upon the original Swin Transformer by focusing on scalability and better performance. Its key innovation, the shifted windowing scheme, allows the model to capture both local and global features more effectively at multiple resolutions. This upgrade enhances the model's ability to handle various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and classification.

One of the remarkable achievements of Swin Transformer V2 is the successful training of a 3 billion-parameter model capable of processing high-resolution images up to 1,536Ã—1,536 pixels \cite{liu2022swintransformerv2scaling}. Such scalability has set new benchmarks on widely recognized datasets. For instance, Swin Transformer V2 has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet-V2 dataset for image classification and the COCO dataset for object detection. These results underscore its ability to generalize effectively across large-scale datasets and complex visual tasks.

The architectural innovations in Swin Transformer V2 include hierarchical representation learning and efficient use of computational resources. These improvements make it particularly suited for real-world applications requiring high-resolution processing, such as medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and autonomous driving. Swin Transformer V2 represents a pivotal step forward in transformer-based vision architectures, driving the field towards more powerful and scalable solutions.

\section{Advancements in Real-Time Object Detection} \label{advancements}

Real-time object detection has become increasingly important for applications requiring immediate responses. The YOLO series has undergone significant transformations, with each iteration introducing architectural innovations to enhance performance and efficiency.

The evolution of YOLO architectures is characterized by changes in backbone network, detection heads, and activation functions. For instance, YOLOv4 uses CSPDarknet53 as its backbone with a PANet neck and an anchor-based head, utilizing the Mish activation function. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 introduce custom backbones and transition towards anchor-free detection heads, adopting the SiLU activation function. These changes aim to improve inference speed, accuracy, and model efficiency.

Evaluating the performance of YOLO models involves analyzing metrics such as mAP and inference speed. Table \ref{tab:yolo_performance_comparison} summarizes these metrics for various YOLO versions on the COCO dataset:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Performance Comparison of YOLO Models on COCO Dataset. Source: \cite{ultralytics_yolov5} \cite{Khanam2024YOLOv11}}
\label{tab:yolo_performance_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{mAP@50:95 (\%)} & \textbf{Inference Speed (ms)} & \textbf{Parameters (M)} & \textbf{FLOPs (B)} \\ \hline
YOLOv4   & 43.5 & 29.0  & 64.0  & 142.0 \\ \hline
YOLOR    & 47.3 & 15.4  & 52.0  & 128.0 \\ \hline
YOLOv5m  & 50.2 & 1.83  & 25.9  & 78.9  \\ \hline
YOLOv8m  & 52.9 & 1.50  & 25.3  & 75.0  \\ \hline
YOLOv11m & 51.5 & 4.7  & 20.1  & 68.0  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

From Table \ref{tab:yolo_performance_comparison}, it is evident that YOLOR offers significant improvements over YOLOv4, achieving a higher mAP@50:95 score of 47.3\% compared to 43.5\% and reducing the inference speed from 29.0 ms to 15.4 ms. However, when compared to more recent models like YOLOv5m and YOLOv8m, YOLOR's performance is competitive but not leading in terms of accuracy and inference speed. For instance, YOLOv8m achieves a higher mAP@50:95 of 52.9\% with a faster inference speed of 1.50 ms.

Despite this, YOLOR's integration of explicit and implicit knowledge allows it to handle multiple vision tasks without task-specific modifications, offering flexibility that may not be present in other models. Its balance between computational efficiency and detection precision makes it a competitive choice for real-time object detection applications that benefit from its unique architectural approach.

The advancements in YOLO models are also accompanied by improvements in training strategies and data augmentation techniques. For example, YOLOv4 introduced Mosaic data augmentation, which combines four images into one during training, enhancing the model's ability to detect objects at varying scales and contexts \cite{bochkovskiy2020yolov4optimalspeedaccuracy}.  Subsequent versions have refined these techniques, contributing to improved generalization and robustness in object detection tasks.

These enhancements have expanded the applicability of YOLO architectures across various domains. From autonomous driving and surveillance to medical imaging and agriculture, the improved accuracy and efficiency of YOLO models have facilitated their deployment in real-time object detection scenarios, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness in diverse environments.

The continuous development of YOLO models indicates a trend towards more efficient architectures capable of handling complex detection tasks with higher accuracy and lower computational costs. Future research may focus on integrating advanced attention mechanisms, exploring transformer-based architectures, and enhancing the models' ability to generalize across different datasets and real-world conditions.

\section{Discussion and Future Work} \label{discussions}

Advancements in object detection have significantly transformed computer vision, with models such as R-CNN improving accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency, and single-stage detectors like YOLO enabling real-time applications. Recent transformer-based models, such as DETR, have redefined detection pipelines with end-to-end training, eliminating traditional components like anchor boxes. However, these advancements come with challenges, including resource-intensive training, poor performance on small objects, and difficulties in dense scenes.

Detecting small objects remains challenging because of the low resolution of feature maps in deep models. Techniques like multi-scale representation and context-aware modeling can address this, but balancing accuracy and computational efficiency is critical. Additionally, dense object scenes pose challenges for anchor-free methods, requiring innovations in keypoint-based or adaptive techniques. Resource optimization is essential for deploying state-of-the-art models in mobile and embedded environments, where lightweight architectures and quantization are promising approaches.

Ethical concerns, including biases in training data and privacy risks in surveillance, demand urgent attention. Addressing biases requires diverse datasets and fairness-aware training techniques, while privacy-preserving methodologies, such as federated learning, can mitigate risks in sensitive applications.

Future research should focus on improving small object detection through multi-scale and attention mechanisms, accelerating convergence in transformer-based models, and exploring self-supervised learning to reduce dependency on labeled datasets. Lightweight architectures and transfer learning are critical for ensuring scalability and efficiency. Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration among technologists, ethicists, and policymakers is vital to ensure responsible and equitable deployment of object detection systems.

By addressing these challenges, the field can achieve more efficient, accurate, and ethically sound object detection solutions, enabling broader applications across diverse domains.
